# Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The project
shows the character of Rick and Morty Season using the [Rick and morty API endpoint](https://rickandmortyapi.com)

## 🌟 Features

This React single-page application (SPA) showcases the characters from the Rick and Morty series with the following features:

### Core Features

1. **Home and Profile Pages**: The SPA consists of two main pages: Home and Profile.
2. **Character Table**: On the Home page, a table displays a list of characters retrieved from the [Rick & Morty API’s Character endpoint](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). The table includes the following columns:

   - **Avatar**: Displaying the character's image.
   - **Name**: Showing the character's name.
   - **Species**: Indicating the species of the character.
   - **Status**: Denoting the character's current status.

3. **Character Profile**: Clicking on a character's name navigates to a Profile page, where detailed information about the character is displayed. The data is dynamically fetched from the API endpoint.

4. **Back Button**: The Profile page features a Back button, allowing users to easily navigate back to the Home page and the main table of characters.

### Bonus Features

- **Pagination**: The main table on the Home page supports pagination, enhancing usability by allowing users to navigate through different sets of character data easily.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can quickly find characters by using the search field on the Home page. The search operates on an `onChange` event, instantly filtering the displayed rows based on the entered search string.

### Note:

- The initial version displays the first batch of data without considering pagination. However, pagination has been added as a bonus feature to improve the user experience.

Feel free to explore the application and discover the intriguing world of Rick and Morty through the detailed character profiles!
